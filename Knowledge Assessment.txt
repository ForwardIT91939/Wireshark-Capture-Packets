Wireshark - Capture - Packets
Assigned Graded Assessment (Multiple Choice)

O = Incorrect
X = Correct
------------------------------
1) A new analyst has just joined a company and cant seem to see any packets coming through on Wireshark. What should be done to help the analyst? 
   O Have the analyst install Wireshark.
   X Add the analyst to the Wireshark group.
   O Have the analyst run Wireshark as sudo
   O Have the analyst log in as root
To help the analyst view packets on Wireshark, add the analyst to the wireshark group.

2) A team member is looking to capture ethernet traffic on the server. The team member says the traffic is visible, but the capture file cannot be saved. Which is a likely solution?
   X Stop capturing.
   O Select the correct network.
   O Start capturing.
   O Close the capture file.
The capture must be stopped before the file can be saved. 

3) A colleague is working on observing only HTTPS packets from an existing capture file. Which filter should be used? 
   O Capturing filter with http.
   X Display filter with tcp.port == 443
   O Display filter with http.
   O Capture filter with tcp.port == 443
The display filter with tcp.port == 443 should be used to observe only HTTPS packets from an existing capture file.

4) An analyst has been alerted of strange network activity coming from IP address 18.160.96.85 and has been tasked with locating all the packets containing the IP address in a Wireshark capture. Which filter should be used?
   O ip.addr = 18.160.96.85 
   O ip.src == 18.160.96.85 
   O ip.dst == 18.160.96.85
   X ip.addr == 18.160.96.85
The filter ip.addr == 18.160.96.85 is used to locate all of the packets containing the IP address.

5) A server has a lot of traffic on a particular IP address. To observe other packets, the analyst just wants to see those packets not associated with IP address 18.160.96.85. Which filter should be used?
   X !(ip.addr == 18.160.96.85 ) and tcp.port == 443
   O (ip.addr != 18.160.96.85) and tcp.port == 80
   O ! (ip.addr = 18.160.96.85) or tcp.port == 443
   O (ip.addr != 18.160.96.85 ) or tcp.port == 443
To observe all other packets not associated with IP address 18.160.96.85, the filter !(ip.addr == 18.160.96.85 ) and tcp.port == 443 should be used.
